### Gesture Classification using Deep Learning  

This repository focuses on **gesture classification** using deep learning techniques. It includes:  

- **ResNet50 from scratch**: A custom implementation trained with the SGD optimizer.  
- **Fine-tuned models**: Pretrained **Xception** and **DenseNet** models optimized for gesture recognition.  

### Features:  
âœ” Implemented using **Keras & TensorFlow**  
âœ” Training from scratch and fine-tuning approaches  
âœ” Optimized for **gesture recognition tasks**  

This project serves as a benchmark for experimenting with different architectures in **gesture classification**. ðŸš€
